        <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

        <p>This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued for payments made through Buy Thank You. Please read this policy carefully before making any payment.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> All payments made through Buy Thank You represent voluntary appreciation gestures and are generally considered final and non-refundable. However, we understand that technical errors and unauthorized transactions can occur, and we have provisions for such cases.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Non-Refundable Nature of Payments</h3>
        <p>Buy Thank You facilitates "Thank You" payments as a form of monetary appreciation. Once a payment is successfully processed and delivered to the recipient, it is considered final and non-refundable under normal circumstances.</p>

        <p>This is because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payments represent voluntary gestures of gratitude</li>
            <li>Recipients may have already received and utilized the funds</li>
            <li>The transaction is a completed transfer of value</li>
            <li>There is no exchange of goods or services that can be "returned"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Service Nature</h3>
        <p>Buy Thank You is a digital payment service, not a marketplace for goods or services. Traditional "return" policies do not apply. Once a payment is sent, the transaction is complete.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligible Refund Cases</h2>

        <p>Despite our general non-refund policy, we will issue refunds in the following exceptional circumstances:</p>

        <h3>2.1 Technical Errors</h3>
        <p><strong>Duplicate Transactions:</strong> If a payment was processed multiple times due to a technical glitch or system error, we will refund the duplicate charges.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You clicked "Pay Now" once but were charged twice due to a technical error.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Unauthorized Transactions</h3>
        <p>If you can provide proof that a transaction was made without your authorization, we will investigate and issue a refund if confirmed.</p>
        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Police report or FIR (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Bank statement showing the unauthorized charge</li>
            <li>Any other supporting documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Payment Gateway Errors</h3>
        <p>If your payment failed but the amount was still deducted from your account, we will process a full refund once verified.</p>
        <p><strong>Common scenarios:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment shows as "Failed" but amount was debited</li>
            <li>Transaction timeout with amount deducted</li>
            <li>Payment gateway processing error</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Incorrect Amount Charged</h3>
        <p>If you were charged an amount different from what you selected, we will refund the difference or the full amount, depending on the situation.</p>

        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>

        <p>Refunds will <strong>NOT</strong> be issued in the following cases:</p>

        <h3>3.1 Change of Mind</h3>
        <p>Once a payment is successfully completed, refunds will not be issued simply because you changed your mind or regretted the payment.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Disputes with Recipients</h3>
        <p>Buy Thank You is not responsible for disputes between payers and recipients. We act only as a payment facilitator. Any disagreements about the use of funds or recipient behavior must be resolved directly between the parties.</p>

        <h3>3.3 User Error</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting the wrong amount by mistake</li>
            <li>Sending payment to the wrong recipient (if you entered recipient details)</li>
            <li>Misunderstanding the purpose of the payment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Dissatisfaction with Service Quality</h3>
        <p>Since Buy Thank You is a payment facilitation service (not a service provider receiving the payment), refunds will not be issued based on dissatisfaction with any services rendered by the payment recipient.</p>

        <h2>4. Refund Request Process</h2>

        <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please follow this process:</p>

        <div class="timeline">

            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Review Process</h3>
            <p>Our team will review your request within <strong>3-5 business days</strong> and may contact you for additional information.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Decision Notification</h3>
            <p>You will receive an email with our decision. If approved, we will proceed with the refund. If denied, we will provide a clear explanation.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Refund Processing</h3>
            <p>If your refund is approved, it will be processed within <strong>7-10 business days</strong>. The refund will be credited to your original payment method.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Refund Timeline and Method</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Processing Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review Period:</strong> 3-5 business days from request submission</li>
            <li><strong>Refund Processing:</strong> 7-10 business days after approval</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Credit:</strong> Additional 5-7 business days for the amount to appear in your account (depends on your bank)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Refund Method</h3>
        <p>Refunds will be credited to the <strong>original payment method</strong> used for the transaction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UPI Payments:</strong> Refunded to the same UPI ID</li>
            <li><strong>Credit/Debit Card:</strong> Refunded to the same card</li>
            <li><strong>Net Banking:</strong> Refunded to the linked bank account</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Partial Refunds</h3>
        <p>In some cases, partial refunds may be issued (e.g., refunding only the excess amount if you were overcharged). The refund amount will be clearly communicated to you.</p>

        <h2>6. Cancellation Policy</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Pre-Payment Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You can cancel a payment <strong>before completing</strong> the transaction by simply closing the payment window or clicking "Cancel" on the payment gateway page. No charges will be applied.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Post-Payment Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Once a payment is successfully completed, it cannot be cancelled. The transaction is immediately processed and delivered to the recipient. You may request a refund if you meet the eligible criteria outlined in Section 2.</p>

        <h2>7. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Bank Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>If you initiate a chargeback through your bank or card issuer without contacting us first, we may temporarily suspend your access to our service pending investigation. We encourage you to contact us directly to resolve issues before filing a chargeback.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>If you disagree with our refund decision, you may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request a review by providing additional evidence</li>
            <li>Escalate the matter to your payment provider</li>
            <li>Seek legal remedies as per applicable law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Payment Gateway Refund Policies</h2>

        <p>Refunds are subject to the policies of our third-party payment gateway partners (Razorpay, UPI, etc.). In some cases, refund timelines may be affected by their processing times.</p>

        <h2>9. Currency and Fees</h2>

        <h3>9.1 Refund Amount</h3>
        <p>Refunds will be issued in Indian Rupees (INR), the same currency in which the payment was made.</p>

        <h3>9.2 Transaction Fees</h3>
        <p>Buy Thank You does not charge any transaction fees. However, if your payment provider (bank, card issuer) charged fees, those fees are typically non-refundable and will not be reimbursed by us.</p>

        <h2>10. Failed Transactions</h2>

        <p>If a transaction fails and the amount is deducted from your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In most cases, the amount will be automatically reversed by your bank within 5-7 business days</li>
            <li>If the reversal does not occur, contact us with transaction details for manual investigation</li>
            <li>We will coordinate with the payment gateway to expedite the refund</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Refund Limitations</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Refunds are only available for transactions made through Buy Thank You's official platform</li>
            <li>Refund requests submitted after 30 days of the transaction may not be processed</li>
            <li>Repeated refund requests for non-eligible reasons may result in account restrictions</li>
        </ul>
